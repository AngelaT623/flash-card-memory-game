# Remembering the good times (2020 COVID edition):
2020 has been a hard year for everyone, so I built a flash card memory game to help us get through these times.

 Remembering the good times (2020 COVID edition) is a game app for players who want to strengthen their mind online. This single player game gives you excitement and suspense with every flip.
Play as much as your heart desires and we'll keep score. As the player you will have the option to play again or start a new game if it get too difficult. The upgrades to come will be multi-player or against the computer, levels (easy, medium, hard) and so much more. Stay strong beautiful world!
