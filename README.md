# Remembering the good times (2020 COVID edition):
2020 has been a hard year for everyone, so I built a flashcard memory game to help us get through these times.

Remembering the good times (2020 COVID edition) is a game app for players who want to strengthen their mind online. This single-player game gives you excitement and suspense with every flip. Play as much as your heart desires and we'll keep score. As the player you will have the option to play again or start a new game if it gets too difficult. The upgrades to come will be multi-player or against the computer, levels (easy, medium, hard) and so much more. Stay strong beautiful world!

# Game rules:
1. Click on two different cards to see if they match. If they match you get 1 point.
2. If the two cards don't match they will be flipped back over for you to try again. Try to remember where they are for your next turns.
3. When you have found all matches the score will show that you have won.
4. You can restart a game at anytime, but will lose your all points. Points will remain if you start a new game, but have won all previous games.
