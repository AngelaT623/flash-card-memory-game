# Project Description

My app is called Remembering the good times (2020 COVID edition). It's a game app for players who want to strengthen their minds online. This is a single-player game that gives you excitement and suspense with every flip. Play as much as you would like and don't bother remembering your score this game does it for you. As the user, you will have the option to play again or start a new game it if get too tough. In the future, I'd like to add a multi-player feature where one player can play against the computer or your favorite pal.
